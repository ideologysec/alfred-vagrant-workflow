# Alfred Vagrant Workflow

This is a workflow for Alfred2 which enables quick control over [Vagrant](vagrantup.com).

## Functionality:
* Listing all existing Vagrant machines
* Running actions (up, halt, provision, etc) on specific machines or whole environents
* Connecting to machines via SSH or RDP

**Note:** This is work in progress.
